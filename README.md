# Nix Macbook Config

# About
Looking at moving away from my dotfiles repo and trying out a new way to setup my system.
Currently this is only setup for an M1 Macbook Pro and is more an exploration then a commitment.

# Setup 
Requires nix-darwin and home-manager to be installed (along with Nix)

I'd recommend using this as a point of reference more than just copying it. I barely know what I'm doing so its a tad clobbered

- `git clone https://github.com/xanderle/config ~/.nixpkgs`
- `darwin-rebuild switch`

Tada everythings built and system is setup!
